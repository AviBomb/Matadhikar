# Codefundo
Problem Statement:
Develop an application where the citizen with a valid voter ID card provided by the government can vote during the elections from across the globe. The votes thus collected, can then be counted for declaration of the results of the elections.

Proposed Solution:
The database is populated with the voter ID number, Ward number and the district number for each citizen above 18 and who has a voter ID card. The citizen can log on to the application and enter their ID number and password to log on. The voter will then be presented with the candidate from that ward for those elections alongside the party name. The voter can then select one of the options provided. These details will be stored in a decentralized public ledger which is accessible by the public. After the elections are over, these transaction details will be taken together and counted for in the name of different parties. 

Voting Process:
